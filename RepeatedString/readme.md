## Problem
Lilah has a string, *s*, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times. Given an integer, *n*, find and print the number of letter a's in the first *n* letters of Lilah's infinite string.  
For example, if the string *s* = *'abcac'* and *n* = 10, the substring we consider is *abcacabcac*, the first 10 characters of her infinite string. There are 4 occurrences of a in the substring.

## Function Description

repeatedString has the following parameter(s):  
- s: a string to repeat
- n: the number of characters to consider

## Input Format
The first line contains a single string, *s*. 
The second line contains an integer, *n*.

## Output Format
Print a single integer denoting the number of letter a's in the first letters of the infinite string created by repeating infinitely many times.
